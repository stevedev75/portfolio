                <p><h4>Hello! My name is Stephen Dever, and I am currently a Full Flex Web Development student in the University of Pennsylvania’s coding bootcamp. Previously, I worked in and around the higher education arena for over twenty years both at the university level as well as in the private sector, as an independent educational consultant. I hold a bachelor’s degree in English and a master’s degree in Education from Saint Joseph’s University.</h4></p>
                <p><h4>In my most recent roles, I was a power user of various educational technology products and platforms which piqued my interest in web development, eventually leading me to this exciting pivot. Now, as I am entering the “Career 2.0” phase of my life I couldn’t be more pleased about what I have already learned and what I will be learning during the rest of this six-month program. So far, we have covered content in HTML and Advanced CSS, and we will be continuing to JavaScript and developing many other in-demand programming skills throughout the course of this bootcamp. Stay tuned as I will be updating both the content and the style of this web page frequently!</h4></p>
