# Portfolio

## Portfolio to showcase my projects to potential employers

My motivation for this project was to update my repository and my one-page web application from scratch 
(using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Google Fonts) as a professional portfolio to house the different applications and projects I am
proud of that will also be of interest to potential employers when I begin the job search process during the last third of this bootcamp.

I built this project as a showcase to potential employers, to demonstrate some of my HTML and CSS skills
in action, and eventually as a repository for robust examples of my programming projects. 

This application solves the problem often found in non-mobile-friendly and non-responsive web applications
that do not adjust to different sized viewing screens. 

In this project, I learned a tremendous amount of information about responsive web pages that include
“flexbox” and “media queries” in their design, in addition to figuring out to make small corrections with my design in CSS that compounded, make the web page more attractive.
