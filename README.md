## Portfolio to showcase my projects to potential employers

My motivation for this project was to create a repository and a one-page web application from scratch 
(using HTML and CSS) as a professional portfolio to house the different applications and projects I am
proud of that will also be of interest to potential employers when I begin the job search process
towards the end of this bootcamp.

I built this project as a showcase to potential employers, to demonstrate some of my HTML and CSS skills
in action, and eventually as a repository for robust examples of my programming projects. 

This application solves the problem often found in non-mobile-friendly and non-responsive web applications
that do not adjust to different sized viewing screens. 

In this project, I learned a tremendous amount of information about responsive web pages that include
“flexbox” and “media queries” in their design. 

Please see screenshot to preview UI:
